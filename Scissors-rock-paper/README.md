# Scissors, Rock, Paper Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Scissors, Rock, Paper" in Python. The program asks the player to input their choice (0 for rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors) and then generates a random choice for the computer. It then compares the two choices and determines the winner.
# How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your choice by typing 0 for rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors.
3. The computer will randomly choose its own move.
4. The program will determine the winner and display the results.
5. To play again, run the program again.
